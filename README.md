# SIOP2021
Shared SIOP projects

1) Amount of time on different activities for different groups (time spent on work at home, time spent with family at home - TBD)

2) Coping strategies of people who are working at home

3) Magical window of 2-3 days per week which is optimal - maybe the CPS dataset has information on this
